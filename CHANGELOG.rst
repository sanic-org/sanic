Version 19.12.0
---------------

Bugfixes
********

- Fix blueprint middleware application

  Currently, any blueprint middleware registered, irrespective of which blueprint was used to do so, was
  being applied to all of the routes created by the :code:`@app` and :code:`@blueprint` alike.

  As part of this change, the blueprint based middleware application is enforced based on where they are
  registered.

  - If you register a middleware via :code:`@blueprint.middleware` then it will apply only to the routes defined by the blueprint.
  - If you register a middleware via :code:`@blueprint_group.middleware` then it will apply to all blueprint based routes that are part of the group.
  - If you define a middleware via :code:`@app.middleware` then it will be applied on all available routes (`#37 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/37>`__)
- Fix `url_for` behavior with missing SERVER_NAME

  If the `SERVER_NAME` was missing in the `app.config` entity, the `url_for` on the `request` and  `app` were failing
  due to an `AttributeError`. This fix makes the availability of `SERVER_NAME` on our `app.config` an optional behavior. (`#1707 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/1707>`__)


Improved Documentation
**********************

- Move docs from MD to RST

  Moved all docs from markdown to restructured text like the rest of the docs to unify the scheme and make it easier in
  the future to update documentation. (`#1691 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/1691>`__)
- Fix documentation for `get` and `getlist` of the `request.args`

  Add additional example for showing the usage of `getlist` and fix the documentation string for `request.args` behavior (`#1704 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/1704>`__)


Version 19.6.3
--------------

Features
********

- Enable Towncrier Support

  As part of this feature, `towncrier` is being introduced as a mechanism to partially  automate the process
  of generating and managing change logs as part of each of pull requests. (`#1631 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/1631>`__)


Improved Documentation
**********************

- Documentation infrastructure changes

  - Enable having a single common `CHANGELOG` file for both GitHub page and documentation
  - Fix Sphinix deprecation warnings
  - Fix documentation warnings due to invalid `rst` indentation
  - Enable common contribution guidelines file across GitHub and documentation via `CONTRIBUTING.rst` (`#1631 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/1631>`__)

Deprecations and Removals
*************************

  *
    `#1544 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1544>`_
    Drop dependency on distutil

  *
    `#1562 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1562>`_

.. warning::
    Sanic will not support Python 3.5 from version 19.6 and forward. However,
    version 18.12LTS will have its support period extended thru December 2020, and
    therefore passing Python's official support version 3.5, which is set to expire
    in September 2020.


Version 19.3
------------

Features
********

  *
    `#1497 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1497>`_
    Add support for zero-length and RFC 5987 encoded filename for
    multipart/form-data requests.

  *
    `#1484 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1484>`_
    The type of ``expires`` attribute of ``sanic.cookies.Cookie`` is now
    enforced to be of type ``datetime``.

  *
    `#1482 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1482>`_
    Add support for the ``stream`` parameter of ``sanic.Sanic.add_route()``
    available to ``sanic.Blueprint.add_route()``.

  *
    `#1481 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1481>`_
    Accept negative values for route parameters with type ``int`` or ``number``.

  *
    `#1476 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1476>`_
    Deprecated the use of ``sanic.request.Request.raw_args`` - it has a
    fundamental flaw in which is drops repeated query string parameters.
    Added ``sanic.request.Request.query_args`` as a replacement for the
    original use-case.

  *
    `#1472 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1472>`_
    Remove an unwanted ``None`` check in Request class ``repr`` implementation.
    This changes the default ``repr`` of a Request from ``<Request>`` to
    ``<Request: None />``

  *
    `#1470 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1470>`_
    Added 2 new parameters to ``sanic.app.Sanic.create_server``\ :


    * ``return_asyncio_server`` - whether to return an asyncio.Server.
    * ``asyncio_server_kwargs`` - kwargs to pass to ``loop.create_server`` for
      the event loop that sanic is using.

    This is a breaking change.

  *
    `#1499 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1499>`_
    Added a set of test cases that test and benchmark route resolution.

  *
    `#1457 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1457>`_
    The type of the ``"max-age"`` value in a ``sanic.cookies.Cookie`` is now
    enforced to be an integer. Non-integer values are replaced with ``0``.

  *
    `#1445 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1445>`_
    Added the ``endpoint`` attribute to an incoming ``request``\ , containing the
    name of the handler function.

  *
    `#1423 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1423>`_
    Improved request streaming. ``request.stream`` is now a bounded-size buffer
    instead of an unbounded queue. Callers must now call
    ``await request.stream.read()`` instead of ``await request.stream.get()``
    to read each portion of the body.

    This is a breaking change.

Bugfixes
********


  *
    `#1502 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1502>`_
    Sanic was prefetching ``time.time()`` and updating it once per second to
    avoid excessive ``time.time()`` calls. The implementation was observed to
    cause memory leaks in some cases. The benefit of the prefetch appeared
    to negligible, so this has been removed. Fixes
    `#1500 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1500>`_

  *
    `#1501 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1501>`_
    Fix a bug in the auto-reloader when the process was launched as a module
    i.e. ``python -m init0.mod1`` where the sanic server is started
    in ``init0/mod1.py`` with ``debug`` enabled and imports another module in
    ``init0``.

  *
    `#1376 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1376>`_
    Allow sanic test client to bind to a random port by specifying
    ``port=None`` when constructing a ``SanicTestClient``

  *
    `#1399 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1399>`_
    Added the ability to specify middleware on a blueprint group, so that all
    routes produced from the blueprints in the group have the middleware
    applied.

  *
    `#1442 <https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1442>`_
    Allow the the use the ``SANIC_ACCESS_LOG`` environment variable to
    enable/disable the access log when not explicitly passed to ``app.run()``.
    This allows the access log to be disabled for example when running via
    gunicorn.

Added a test for pickling and unpickling blueprints Added a test for pickling and unpickling sanic itself Added a test for enabling multiprocessing on an app with a blueprint (only useful to catch this bug if the tests are run on Windows).
