# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Sanic releases long term support release once a year in December. LTS releases receive bug and security updates for **24 months**. Interim releases throughout the year occur every three months, and are supported until the subsequent interim release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we ask that you **do not** create an issue on GitHub. Instead, please [send a message to the core-devs](https://community.sanicframework.org/g/core-devs) on the community forums. This will help to not publicize the issue until the team can address it and resolve it.
