Cookies
=======

Cookies are pieces of data which persist inside a user's browser. Sanic can
both read and write cookies, which are stored as key-value pairs.

.. warning::

    Cookies can be freely altered by the client. Therefore you cannot just store
    data such as login information in cookies as-is, as they can be freely altered
    by the client. To ensure data you store in cookies is not forged or tampered
    with by the client, use something like `itsdangerous`_ to cryptographically
    sign the data.


Reading cookies
---------------

A user's cookies can be accessed via the ``Request`` object's ``cookies`` dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    from sanic.response import text

    @app.route("/cookie")
    async def test(request):
        test_cookie = request.cookies.get('test')
        return text("Test cookie set to: {}".format(test_cookie))

Writing cookies
---------------

When returning a response, cookies can be set on the ``Response`` object.

.. code-block:: python

    from sanic.response import text

    @app.route("/cookie")
    async def test(request):
        response = text("There's a cookie up in this response")
        response.cookies['test'] = 'It worked!'
        response.cookies['test']['domain'] = '.gotta-go-fast.com'
        response.cookies['test']['httponly'] = True
        return response

Deleting cookies
----------------

Cookies can be removed semantically or explicitly.

.. code-block:: python

    from sanic.response import text

    @app.route("/cookie")
    async def test(request):
        response = text("Time to eat some cookies muahaha")

        # This cookie will be set to expire in 0 seconds
        del response.cookies['kill_me']

        # This cookie will self destruct in 5 seconds
        response.cookies['short_life'] = 'Glad to be here'
        response.cookies['short_life']['max-age'] = 5
        del response.cookies['favorite_color']

        # This cookie will remain unchanged
        response.cookies['favorite_color'] = 'blue'
        response.cookies['favorite_color'] = 'pink'
        del response.cookies['favorite_color']

        return response

Response cookies can be set like dictionary values and have the following
parameters available:

- ``expires`` (datetime): The time for the cookie to expire on the client's browser.
- ``path`` (string): The subset of URLs to which this cookie applies.  Defaults to /.
- ``comment`` (string): A comment (metadata).
- ``domain`` (string): Specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid. An
  explicitly specified domain must always start with a dot.
- ``max-age`` (number): Number of seconds the cookie should live for.
- ``secure`` (boolean): Specifies whether the cookie will only be sent via HTTPS.
- ``httponly`` (boolean): Specifies whether the cookie cannot be read by Javascript.
- ``samesite`` (string): Default is browser dependent, specification states (Lax, Strict, and None) are valid values.
