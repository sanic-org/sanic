Exceptions
==========

Exceptions can be thrown from within request handlers and will automatically be
handled by Sanic. Exceptions take a message as their first argument, and can
also take a status code to be passed back in the HTTP response.

Throwing an exception
---------------------

To throw an exception, simply `raise` the relevant exception from the
`sanic.exceptions` module.

.. code-block:: python

    from sanic.exceptions import ServerError

    @app.route('/killme')
    async def i_am_ready_to_die(request):
        raise ServerError("Something bad happened", status_code=500)

You can also use the `abort` function with the appropriate status code:

.. code-block:: python

    from sanic.exceptions import abort
    from sanic.response import text

    @app.route('/youshallnotpass')
    async def no_no(request):
            abort(401)
            # this won't happen
            text("OK")

Handling exceptions
-------------------

To override Sanic's default handling of an exception, the `@app.exception`
decorator is used. The decorator expects a list of exceptions to handle as
arguments. You can pass `SanicException` to catch them all! The decorated
exception handler function must take a `Request` and `Exception` object as
arguments.

.. code-block:: python

    from sanic.response import text
    from sanic.exceptions import NotFound

    @app.exception(NotFound)
    async def ignore_404s(request, exception):
        return text("Yep, I totally found the page: {}".format(request.url))

You can also add an exception handler as such:

.. code-block:: python

    from sanic import Sanic

    async def server_error_handler(request, exception):
        return text("Oops, server error", status=500)

    app = Sanic("error_handler_example")
    app.error_handler.add(Exception, server_error_handler)

In some cases, you might want to add some more error handling
functionality to what is provided by default. In that case, you
can subclass Sanic's default error handler as such:

.. code-block:: python

    from sanic import Sanic
    from sanic.handlers import ErrorHandler

    class CustomErrorHandler(ErrorHandler):
        def default(self, request, exception):
            ''' handles errors that have no error handlers assigned '''
            # You custom error handling logic...
            return super().default(request, exception)

    app = Sanic("custom_error_handler_example")
    app.error_handler = CustomErrorHandler()

Useful exceptions
-----------------

Some of the most useful exceptions are presented below:

- `NotFound`: called when a suitable route for the request isn't found.
- `ServerError`: called when something goes wrong inside the server. This
  usually occurs if there is an exception raised in user code.

See the `sanic.exceptions` module for the full list of exceptions to throw.
