## Version 21.12.0 ðŸ”¹

### Features
- [#2260](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/2260) Allow early Blueprint registrations to still apply later added objects
- [#2262](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/2262) Noisy exceptions - force logging of all exceptions

- [#2277](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/2277) Change signal routing for increased consistency

There is now an additional step to loop thru the returned signals for proper matching on the requirements. If signals are being dispatched using `app.dispatch` or `bp.dispatch`, there is no change.
