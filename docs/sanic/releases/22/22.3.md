## Version 22.3.0

### Features

    - üö® *BREAKING CHANGE*: The old `sanic.worker.GunicornWorker` has been **removed**. To run Sanic with `gunicorn`, you should use it thru `uvicorn` [as described in their docs](https://www.uvicorn.org/#running-with-gunicorn).
    - üßÅ *SIDE EFFECT*: Named background tasks are now supported, even in Python 3.7
- [#2357](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/2357) Parse `Authorization` header as `Request.credentials`
- [#2361](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/2361) Add config option to skip `Touchup` step in application startup
- [#2372](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/2372) Updates to CLI help messaging
- [#2382](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/2382) Downgrade warnings to backwater debug messages

- [#2415](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/2415) Better exception for bad URL parsing
- [sanic-routing#47](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic-routing/pull/47) Add a new extention parameter type: `<file:ext>`, `<file:ext=jpg>`, `<file:ext=jpg|png|gif|svg>`, `<file=int:ext>`, `<file=int:ext=jpg|png|gif|svg>`, `<file=float:ext=tar.gz>`
    - üë∂ *BETA FEATURE*: This feature will not work with `path` type matching, and is being released as a beta feature only.
- [sanic-routing#57](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic-routing/pull/57) Change `register_pattern` to accept a `str` or `Pattern`
- [sanic-routing#58](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic-routing/pull/58) Default matching on non-empty strings only, and new `strorempty` pattern type
    - üö® *BREAKING CHANGE*: Previously a route with a dynamic string parameter (`/<foo>` or `/<foo:str>`) would match on any string, including empty strings. It will now **only** match a non-empty string. To retain the old behavior, you should use the new parameter type: `/<foo:strorempty>`.

- [sanic-routing#60](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic-routing/pull/60) Add requirements check on regex routes (this resolves, for example, multiple static directories with differing `host` values)

### Deprecations and Removals
- [#2362](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/2362) 22.3 Deprecations and changes
    1. `debug=True` and `--debug` do _NOT_ automatically run `auto_reload`

    4. `ErrorHandler.lookup` requires two positional args
    5. Unused websocket protocol args removed
