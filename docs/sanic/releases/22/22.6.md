### Features
- [#2378](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/2378) Introduce HTTP/3 and autogeneration of TLS certificates in `DEBUG` mode
    - ðŸ‘¶ *EARLY RELEASE FEATURE*: Serving Sanic over HTTP/3 is an early release feature. It does not yet fully cover the HTTP/3 spec, but instead aims for feature parity with Sanic's existing HTTP/1.1 server. Websockets, WebTransport, push responses are examples of some features not yet implemented.
    - ðŸ“¦ *EXTRA REQUIREMENT*: Not all HTTP clients are capable of interfacing with HTTP/3 servers. You may need to install a [HTTP/3 capable client](https://curl.se/docs/http3.html).
    - ðŸ“¦ *EXTRA REQUIREMENT*: In order to use TLS autogeneration, you must install either [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) or [trustme](https://github.com/python-trio/trustme).
