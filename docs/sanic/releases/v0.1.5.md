# v0.1.5 (2016-10-23)

- Cookies
- Blueprint listeners and ordering
- Faster Router
- Fix: Incomplete file reads on medium+ sized post requests

### Breaking:

- `after_start` and `before_stop` now pass sanic as their first argument. Current event listeners will need to be updated to accept the new argument
