"""
Example intercepting uncaught exceptions using Sanic's error handler framework.
This may be useful for developers wishing to use Sentry, Airbrake, etc.
or a custom system to log and monitor unexpected errors in production.
First we create our own class inheriting from Handler in sanic.exceptions,
and pass in an instance of it when we create our Sanic instance. Inside this
class' default handler, we can do anything including sending exceptions to
an external service.
