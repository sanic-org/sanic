# Sync and Async in Sanic

Sanic is an **asynchronous** framework - it is designed to be responsive to requests, which allows it to theoretically serve more requests, more quickly, than a synchronous framework. Other python asynchronous frameworks also share the same limitations when calling synchronous code, so the guide below will hopefully serve you if you end up in a situation using something other than Sanic in the future.

There are preventable situations where this is not the case. Using synchronous functions in asynchronous code is the biggest hurdle for many Sanic adopters.

## Introduction
Understanding asynchronicity is sometimes baffling even to experienced developers. The point of this mini-guide is to help understand what happens in Sanic, why certain things might not work the way you expect, and will help walk you through some of the impact of synchronous and asynchronous code may have on your Sanic application.

There are many guides to async/await available as of this writing (Dec 2023) so we will not cover everything specifically, instead exploring and reviewing what happens inside Sanic when you use non-blocking (asynchronous) and blocking (synchronous) code.

## Synchronous Execution
Letâ€™s start with as simple an explanation as we can produce and an example. Most python code is synchronous, that is to say when something happens, it must be done in order and must complete before the python interpreter can move on. This is called **blocking** because the process is **blocked** while it waits for each statement to finish.

Our first example, below, is a standard program. The ***execution flow*** can be understood by simply reading the code.

Ex. 1
```py test1.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3.11
import time
from random import randrange

def sync_print(text: str) -> None:
    rand_wait: int = randrange(0,5)
    time.sleep(rand_wait)
    print(f'{text} ({rand_wait}s)')

def main() -> None:
    my_name: str = 'Sanic'
    sync_print('I go first')
    sync_print(f'Hello {my_name}, I run second')
    sync_print('I go third')

main()
```

In the above example, we assign a variable (*my_name*), then we print three lines of text by calling a function. The function, *sync_print* waits 0-5 seconds, then prints the text along with how long the wait was.

The python interpreter runs all four statements in order, and will do so every single time. To change the order of the output simply change the order of the statements.

It produces the following example output:
```sh
I go first (0s)
Hello Sanic, I run second (4s)
I go third (2s)
```

So changing the order of the statements as is done below changes the output:

Ex. 2
```py test2.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3.11
import time
from random import randrange

def sync_print(text: str) -> None:
    rand_wait: int = randrange(0,5)
    time.sleep(rand_wait)
    print(f{text} ({rand_wait}s))

def main() -> None:
    sync_print('I go first')
    sync_print(f'Hello {my_name}, I run second')
    my_name: str = 'Sanic'
    sync_print('I go third')

main()
```

The above example is a good one because it illustrates what happens when something is run before the interpreter has had a chance to execute the statements to make it fully functional. The output is below:

```sh
I go first (4s)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/ssadowski/tmp/test2.py", line 16, in <module>
    main()
  File "/Users/ssadowski/tmp/test2.py", line 12, in main
    sync_print(f'Hello {my_name}, I run second')
                        ^^^^^^^
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'my_name' where it is not associated with a value
```
In this case, the variable *my_name* is defined ***after*** python wants to use it, and an exception - a *UnboundLocalError* - occurs. In the first example, there was no exception because the variable *my_name* was defined before the statement that referenced it.

## Asynchronous Execution

Asynchronous elements must be scheduled. To manage this, python creates a constantly running background loop called an event loop. This works very well for things that need to keep running while other parts of a program are also running.

To achieve this in python, we define a ***coroutine***, ***task***, or a ***future***, which are referred to as ***awaitables*** For this guide, we will only focus on coroutines.

Scheduled code is considered **non-blocking**, because the process should not wait for an awaitable to finish executing.

To illustrate this, the simplest possible example is used below:

Ex. 3
```py test3.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3.11
import asyncio
from random import randrange

async def async_print(text: str) -> None:
    rand_wait: int = randrange(0,5)
    await asyncio.sleep(rand_wait)
    print(text)

async def main() -> None:
    my_name: str = 'Sanic'
    await async_print('I go first')
    await async_print(f'Hello {my_name}, I run second')
    await async_print('I go third')

asyncio.run(main())
```

.. tip:: Note

    ðŸ’¡ Like the use of *async* and *await*, some of the complexity here is deliberately avoided for the sake of a higher level understanding.

Immediately there's much more going on here - we are importing the **asyncio** standard library and there are two new keywords in play, **async** and **await**. It should be noted that asynchronous execution has come quite far since it was first introduced, and much more is done under the hood for the sake of readability and reusability, but in my opinion it masks the inner workings of asynchronous code and prevents people from understanding why it works as well as it does.

In the example, instead of calling print directly, we use the async keyword to create a *coroutine* called **async_print** that takes a single text argument.

Also in the example **main** is now a coroutine as well. This is because coroutines can easily schedule other coroutines and call regular functions, but regular functions cannot easily schedule coroutines.

.. tip:: Note

    ðŸ’¡ It is not impossible for regular functions to schedule coroutines, but it is beyond the scope of this guide.

Scheduling has been referenced several times at this point, and it should be discussed.

There are as many good articles about async/await in python as there are poorly written ones, but one that appears high in search results states that ***await*** pauses execution. That doesn't make sense, though, does it? What would be the point in telling a function that it should just not do anything.

However this guide is not going to dig into the material impact of scheduling, but while analogies in describing async/await are always suspect, consider this example scenario:

You wish to brew a cup of tea.

Using an electric kettle, you fill it with water, and start the kettle.

Most human beings are not that interested in standing at the kettle, doing nothing until it boils, but with regular functions, that's what happens: Fill kettle. Boil. Use water to make drink. The operations happen in order, and you cannot do anything else until they complete.

For someone making a drink, that seems like a waste of time. A person does not need to stand around and watch the kettle until it boils, instead, other things can be done. So the kettle is left to do its task, which by filling it and turning it on, we can consider to be scheduled, and when it is done, we can come back to it and make our hot drink.

Let's review with pythonic pseudocode the two different things going on here:

Ex. 4
```py
def fill(kettle):
    # fills kettle
    kettle.add(water)

def boil_water(kettle):
    # boils water at ocean level
    while kettle.water['temp'] < 100:
        # keep heating water until the water boils
        kettle.heat(100, 'C')
        time.sleep(5) # wait 5 seconds

def make_drink(kettle, drink):
    drink.add(kettle.water)
    drink.steep()

kettle = Kettle() # Empty kettle
drink = Tea() # tea leaves in a cup
fill(kettle)
boil_water(kettle)
make_drink(kettle, drink)
```

Effectively we have the same sequence of events from our very first example, and as mentioned above, we are stuck waiting for the tasks to execute in order, and we would be stuck waiting for the water to boil.
