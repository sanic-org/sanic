## What is it?

First things first, before you jump in the water, you should know that Sanic is different than other frameworks.

Right there in that first sentence there is a huge mistake because Sanic is _both_ a **framework** and a **web server**. In the deployment section we will talk a little bit more about this. 

But, remember, out of the box Sanic comes with everything you need to write, deploy, and scale a production grade web application. ðŸš€

## Goal

> To provide a simple way to get up and running a highly performant HTTP server that is easy to build, to expand, and ultimately to scale.
