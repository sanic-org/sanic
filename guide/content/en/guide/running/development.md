# Development

The first thing that should be mentioned is that the webserver that is integrated into Sanic is **not** just a development server. 

It is production ready out-of-the-box, *unless you enable in debug mode*.

## Debug mode

By setting the debug mode, Sanic will be more verbose in its output and will disable several run-time optimizations.

```python
# server.py
from sanic import Sanic
from sanic.response import json

app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/")
async def hello_world(request):
    return json({"hello": "world"})
```
```sh
sanic server:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=1234 --debug
```


.. danger:: 
    
    Sanic's debug mode will slow down the server's performance, and is **NOT** intended for production environments.

    **DO NOT** enable debug mode in production.



## Automatic Reloader

.. column::

    Sanic offers a way to enable or disable the Automatic Reloader. The easiest way to enable it is using the CLI's `--reload` argument to activate the Automatic Reloader. Every time a Python file is changed, the reloader will restart your application automatically. This is very convenient while developing.

    .. note:: 
    
        The reloader is only available when using Sanic's [worker manager](./manager.md). If you have disabled it using `--single-process` then the reloader will not be available to you.

.. column::

    ```sh
    sanic path.to:app --reload
    ```
    You can also use the shorthand property
    ```sh
    sanic path.to:app -r
    ```


.. column::

    If you have additional directories that you would like to automatically reload on file save (for example, a directory of HTML templates), you can add that using `--reload-dir`.

.. column::

    ```sh
    sanic path.to:app --reload --reload-dir=/path/to/templates
    ```
    Or multiple directories, shown here using the shorthand properties
    ```sh
    sanic path.to:app -r -R /path/to/one -R /path/to/two
    ```


## Development REPL

.. new:: v23.12

    The Sanic CLI comes with a REPL (aka "read-eval-print loop") that can be used to interact with your application. This is useful for debugging and testing. A REPL is the interactive shell that you get when you run `python` without any arguments.

.. column::

    You can start the REPL by passing the `--repl` argument to the Sanic CLI.

.. column::

    ```sh
    sanic path.to.server:app --repl
    ```

.. column::

    Or, perhaps more conveniently, when you run `--dev`, Sanic will automatically start the REPL for you. However, in this case you might be prompted to hit the "ENTER" key before actually starting the REPL.

.. column::

    ```sh
    sanic path.to.server:app --dev
    ```

![](/assets/images/repl.png)

As seen in the screenshot above, the REPL will automatically add a few variables to the global namespace. These are:

- `app` - The Sanic application instance. This is the same instance that is passed to the `sanic` CLI.
- `sanic` - The `sanic` module. This is the same module that is imported when you run `import sanic`.
- `do` - A function that will create a mock `Request` object and pass it to your application. This is useful for testing your application from the REPL.
- `client` - An instance of `httpx.Client` that is configured to make requests to your application. This is useful for testing your application from the REPL. **Note:** This is only available if `httpx` is installed in your environment.

### Async/Await support

.. column::

    The REPL supports `async`/`await` syntax. This means that you can use `await` in the REPL to wait for asynchronous operations to complete. This is useful for testing asynchronous code.

.. column::

    ```python
    >>> await app.ctx.db.fetchval("SELECT 1")
    1 
    ```

### The `app` variable

You need to keep in mind that the `app` variable is your app instance as it existed when the REPL was started. It is the instance that is loaded when running the CLI command. This means that any changes that are made to your source code and subsequently reloaded in the workers will not be reflected in the `app` variable. If you want to interact with the reloaded app instance, you will need to restart the REPL.

However, it is also very useful to have access to the original app instance in the REPL for adhoc testing and debugging.

### The `client` variable

When [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) is installed in your environment, the `client` variable will be available in the REPL. This is an instance of `httpx.Client` that is configured to make requests to your running application.

.. column::

    To use it, simply call one of the HTTP methods on the client. See the [httpx documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org/api/#client) for more information.

.. column::

    ```python
    >>> client.get("/")
    <Response [200 OK]>
    ```

### The `do` function

As discussed above, the `app` instance exists as it did at the time the REPL was started, and as was modified inside the REPL. Any changes to the instance that cause a server to be reloaded will not be reflected in the `app` variable. This is where the `do` function comes in.

Let's say that you have modified your application inside the REPL to add a new route:

```python
>>> @app.get("/new-route")
... async def new_route(request):
...     return sanic.json({"hello": "world"})
...
>>>
```

You can use the `do` function to mock out a request, and pass it to the application as if it were a real HTTP request. This will allow you to test your new route without having to restart the REPL.

```python
>>> await do("/new-route")
Result(request=<Request: GET /new-route>, response=<JSONResponse: 200 application/json>)
```

The `do` function returns a `Result` object that contains the `Request` and `Response` objects that were returned by your application. It is a `NamedTuple`, so you can access the values by name:

```python
>>> result = await do("/new-route")
>>> result.request
<Request: GET /new-route>
>>> result.response
<JSONResponse: 200 application/json>
```

Or, by destructuring the tuple:

```python
>>> request, response = await do("/new-route")
>>> request
<Request: GET /new-route>
>>> response
<JSONResponse: 200 application/json>
```

### When to use `do` vs `client`?

.. column::

    **Use `do` when ...**

    - You want to test a route that does not exist in the running application
    - You want to test a route that has been modified in the REPL
    - You make a change to your application inside the REPL

.. column::

    **Use `client` when ...**

    - You want to test a route that already exists in the running application
    - You want to test a route that has been modified in your source code
    - You want to send an actual HTTP request to your application

*Added in v23.12*

## Complete development mode

.. column::

    If you would like to be in debug mode **and** have the Automatic Reloader running, you can pass `dev=True`. This is equivalent to **debug + auto reload**.

    *Added in v22.3*

.. column::

    ```sh
    sanic path.to:app --dev
    ```
    You can also use the shorthand property
    ```sh
    sanic path.to:app -d
    ```

.. new:: v23.12

    Added to the `--dev` flag in v23.12 is the ability to start a REPL. See the [Development REPL](./development.md#development-repl) section for more information.
    
    As of v23.12, the `--dev` flag is roughly equivalent to `--debug --reload --repl`. Using `--dev` will require you to expressly begin the REPL by hitting "ENTER", while passing the `--repl` flag explicitly starts it.
	
.. column::

    If you would like to disable the REPL while using the `--dev` flag, you can pass `--no-repl`.

.. column::

    ```sh
    sanic path.to:app --dev --no-repl
    ```

## Automatic TLS certificate

When running in `DEBUG` mode, you can ask Sanic to handle setting up localhost temporary TLS certificates. This is helpful if you want to access your local development environment with `https://`.

This functionality is provided by either [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) or [trustme](https://github.com/python-trio/trustme). Both are good choices, but there are some differences. `trustme` is a Python library and can be installed into your environment with `pip`. This makes for easy envrionment handling, but it is not compatible when running a HTTP/3 server. `mkcert` might be a more involved installation process, but can install a local CA and make it easier to use.

.. column::

    You can choose which platform to use by setting `config.LOCAL_CERT_CREATOR`. When set to `"auto"`, it will select either option, preferring `mkcert` if possible.

.. column::

    ```python
    app.config.LOCAL_CERT_CREATOR = "auto"
    app.config.LOCAL_CERT_CREATOR = "mkcert"
    app.config.LOCAL_CERT_CREATOR = "trustme"
    ```

.. column::

    Automatic TLS can be enabled at Sanic server run time:

.. column::

    ```sh
    sanic path.to.server:app --auto-tls --debug
    ```

.. warning:: 

    Localhost TLS certificates (like those generated by both `mkcert` and `trustme`) are **NOT** suitable for production environments. If you are not familiar with how to obtain a *real* TLS certificate, checkout the [How to...](../how-to/tls.md) section.

*Added in v22.6*
