# Need some help?

As an active community of developers, we try to support each other. If you need some help, try one of the following:

.. column::

    ### Discord ðŸ’¬

    Best place to turn for quick answers and live chat

    `#sanic-support` channel on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FARQzAEMAA)

.. column::

    ### Community Forums ðŸ‘¥

    Good for sharing snippets of code and longer support queries

    `Questions and Help` category on the [Forums](https://community.sanicframework.org/c/questions-and-help/6)

---

We also actively monitor the `[sanic]` tag on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sanic).
