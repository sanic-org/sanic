.. tab:: Production-grade
    
    After installing, Sanic has all the tools you need for a scalable, production-grade server—out of the box!

    Including [full TLS support](/en/guide/how-to/tls).

    ```python
    from sanic import Sanic
    from sanic.response import text

    app = Sanic("MyHelloWorldApp")

    @app.get("/")
    async def hello_world(request):
        return text("Hello, world.")
    ```

    ```sh
    sanic path.to.server:app
    [2023-01-31 12:34:56 +0000] [999996] [INFO] Sanic v22.12.0
    [2023-01-31 12:34:56 +0000] [999996] [INFO] Goin' Fast @ http://127.0.0.1:8000

    [2023-01-31 12:34:56 +0000] [999996] [INFO] server: sanic, HTTP/1.1
    [2023-01-31 12:34:56 +0000] [999996] [INFO] python: 3.10.9

    [2023-01-31 12:34:56 +0000] [999997] [INFO] Starting worker [999997]
    ```

.. tab:: TLS server
    
    Running Sanic with TLS enabled is as simple as passing it the file paths...
    ```sh
    sanic path.to.server:app --cert=/path/to/bundle.crt --key=/path/to/privkey.pem
    ```

    ... or the a directory containing `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`

    ```sh
    sanic path.to.server:app --tls=/path/to/certs
    ```

    **Even better**, while you are developing, let Sanic handle setting up local TLS certificates so you can access your site over TLS at [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443)

    ```sh
    sanic path.to.server:app --dev --auto-tls
    ```

.. tab:: Websockets

    Up and running with websockets in no time using the [websockets](https://websockets.readthedocs.io) package.
    ```python
    from sanic import Request, Websocket

    @app.websocket("/feed")
    async def feed(request: Request, ws: Websocket):
        async for msg in ws:
            await ws.send(msg)
    ```

.. tab:: Static files

    Serving static files is of course intuitive and easy. Just name an endpoint and either a file or directory that should be served.

    ```python
    app.static("/", "/path/to/index.html")
    app.static("/uploads/", "/path/to/uploads/")
    ```

    Moreover, serving a directory has two additional features: automatically serving an index, and automatically serving a file browser.
    
    Sanic can automatically serve `index.html` (or any other named file) as an index page in a directory or its subdirectories.
    
    ```python
    app.static(
        "/uploads/",
        "/path/to/uploads/",
        index="index.html"
    )
    ```

    And/or, setup Sanic to display a file browser.

    
    ![image](/assets/images/directory-view.png)

    ```python
    app.static(
        "/uploads/",
        "/path/to/uploads/",
        directory_view=True
    )
    ```

.. tab:: Lifecycle

    Beginning or ending a route with functionality is as simple as adding a decorator.

    ```python
    @app.on_request
    async def add_key(request):
        request.ctx.foo = "bar"

    @app.on_response
    async def custom_banner(request, response):
        response.headers["X-Foo"] = request.ctx.foo
    ```

    Same with server events.

    ```python
    @app.before_server_start
    async def setup_db(app):
        app.ctx.db_pool = await db_setup()

    @app.after_server_stop
    async def setup_db(app):
        await app.ctx.db_pool.shutdown()
    ```

    But, Sanic also allows you to tie into a bunch of built-in events (called signals), or create and dispatch your own.

    ```python
    @app.signal("http.lifecycle.complete")  # built-in
    async def my_signal_handler(conn_info):
        print("Connection has been closed")

    @app.signal("something.happened.ohmy")  # custom
    async def my_signal_handler():
        print("something happened")

    await app.dispatch("something.happened.ohmy")
    ```

.. tab:: Smart error handling

    Raising errors will intuitively result in proper HTTP errors:

    ```python
    raise sanic.exceptions.NotFound  # Automatically responds with HTTP 404
    ```

    Or, make your own:

    ```python
    from sanic.exceptions import SanicException

    class TeapotError(SanicException):
        status_code = 418
        message = "Sorry, I cannot brew coffee"

    raise TeapotError
    ```

    And, when an error does happen, Sanic's beautiful DEV mode error page will help you drill down to the bug quickly.

    ![image](../assets/images/error-div-by-zero.png)

    Regardless, Sanic comes with an algorithm that attempts to respond with HTML, JSON, or text-based errors as appropriate. Don't worry, it is super easy to setup and customize your error handling to your exact needs.

.. tab:: App Inspector

    Check in on your live, running applications (whether local or remote).
    ```sh
    sanic inspect

    And, issue commands like `reload`, `shutdown`, `scale`...

    ```sh
    sanic inspect scale 4
    ```

    ... or even create your own!

    ```sh
    sanic inspect migrations
    ```

.. tab:: Extendable

    In addition to the tools that Sanic comes with, the officially supported [Sanic Extensions](./plugins/sanic-ext/getting-started.md) provides lots of extra goodies to make development easier.

    - **CORS** protection
    - Template rendering with **Jinja**
    - **Dependency injection** into route handlers
    - OpenAPI documentation with **Redoc** and/or **Swagger**
    - Predefined, endpoint-specific response **serializers**
    - Request query arguments and body input **validation**
    - **Auto create** HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE endpoints
    - Live **health monitor**

.. tab:: Developer Experience

    Sanic is **built for building**.

    From the moment it is installed, Sanic includes helpful tools to help the developer get their job done.

    - **One server** - Develop locally in DEV mode on the same server that will run your PRODUCTION application
    - **Auto reload** - Reload running applications every time you save a Python file, but also auto-reload **on any arbitrary directory** like HTML template directories
    - **Debugging tools** - Super helpful (and beautiful) [error pages](/en/guide/best-practices/exceptions) that help you traverse the trace stack easily
    - **Auto TLS** - Running a localhost website with `https` can be difficult, [Sanic makes it easy](/en/guide/how-to/tls)
    - **Streamlined testing** - Built-in testing capabilities, making it easier for developers to create and run tests, ensuring the quality and reliability of their services
    - **Modern Python** - Thoughtful use of type hints to help the developer IDE experience
