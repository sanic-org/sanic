# Version 23.3

.. toc::

## Introduction

This is the first release of the version 23 [release cycle](../../org/policies.md#release-schedule). As such contains some deprecations and hopefully some *small* breaking changes. If you run into any issues, please raise a concern on [GitHub](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/new/choose).

## What to know

More details in the [Changelog](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sanic/changelog.html). Notable new or breaking features, and what to upgrade...

### Nicer traceback formatting

The SCO adopted two projects into the Sanic namespace on GitHub: [tracerite](https://github.com/sanic-org/tracerite) and [html5tagger](https://github.com/sanic-org/html5tagger). These projects team up to provide and incredible new error page with more details to help the debugging process.

This is provided out of the box, and will adjust to display only relevant information whether in DEBUG more or PROD mode.

.. column::

    **Using PROD mode**
    ![image](/assets/images/error-html-no-debug.png)

.. column::

    **Using DEBUG mode**
    ![image](/assets/images/error-html-debug.png)

Light and dark mode HTML pages are available and will be used implicitly.

### Basic file browser on directories

When serving a directory from a static handler, Sanic can be configured to show a basic file browser instead using `directory_view=True`.

.. column::

    ```python
    app.static("/uploads/", "/path/to/dir/", directory_view=True)
    ```

.. column::

    ![image](/assets/images/directory-view.png)

Light and dark mode HTML pages are available and will be used implicitly.

### HTML templating with Python

Because Sanic is using [html5tagger](https://github.com/sanic-org/html5tagger) under the hood to render the [new error pages](#nicer-traceback-formatting), you now have the package available to you to easily generate HTML pages in Python code:

.. column::

    ```python
    from html5tagger import Document
    from sanic import Request, Sanic, html

    app = Sanic("TestApp")

    @app.get("/")
    async def handler(request: Request):
        doc = Document("My Website")
        doc.h1("Hello, world.")
        with doc.table(id="data"):
            doc.tr.th("First").th("Second").th("Third")
            doc.tr.td(1).td(2).td(3)
        doc.p(class_="text")("A paragraph with ")
        doc.a(href="/files")("a link")(" and ").em("formatting")
        return html(doc)
    ```

.. column::

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <h1>Hello, world.</h1>
    <table id=data>
        <tr>
            <th>First
            <th>Second
            <th>Third
        <tr>
            <td>1
            <td>2
            <td>3
    </table>
    <p class=text>
        A paragraph with <a href="/files">a link</a> and <em>formatting</em>
    ```

### Auto-index serving is available on static handlers

Sanic can now be configured to serve an index file when serving a static directory.

```python
app.static("/assets/", "/path/to/some/dir", index="index.html")
```

When using the above, requests to `http://example.com/assets/` will automatically serve the `index.html` file located in that directory.

### Simpler CLI targets

It is common practice for Sanic applications to use the variable `app` as the application instance. Because of this, the CLI application target (the second value of the `sanic` CLI command) now tries to infer the application instance based upon what the target is. If the target is a module that contains an `app` variable, it will use that.

There are now four possible ways to launch a Sanic application from the CLI.

#### 1. Application instance

As normal, providing a path to a module and an application instance will work as expected.

```sh
sanic path.to.module:app          # global app instance
```

#### 2. Application factory

Previously, to serve the factory pattern, you would need to use the `--factory` flag. This can be omitted now.

```sh
sanic path.to.module:create_app   # factory pattern
```

#### 3. Path to launch Sanic Simple Server

Similarly, to launch the Sanic simple server (serve static directory), you previously needed to use the `--simple` flag. This can be omitted now, and instead simply provide the path to the directory.

```sh
sanic ./path/to/directory/        # simple serve
```

#### 4. Python module containing an `app` variable

As stated above, if the target is a module that contains an `app` variable, it will use that (assuming that `app` variable is a `Sanic` instance).

```sh
sanic path.to.module              # module with app instance
```

### More convenient methods for setting and deleting cookies

The old cookie pattern was awkward and clunky. It didn't look like regular Python because of the "magic" going on under the hood.

.. column::

    ðŸ˜± This is not intuitive and is confusing for newcomers.

.. column::

    ```python
    response = text("There's a cookie up in this response")
    response.cookies["test"] = "It worked!"
    response.cookies["test"]["domain"] = ".yummy-yummy-cookie.com"
    response.cookies["test"]["httponly"] = True
    ```

There are now new methods (and completely overhauled `Cookie` and `CookieJar` objects) to make this process more convenient.

.. column::

    ðŸ˜Œ Ahh... Much nicer.

.. column::

    ```python
    response = text("There's a cookie up in this response")
    response.add_cookie(
        "test",
        "It worked!",
        domain=".yummy-yummy-cookie.com",
        httponly=True
    )
    ```

### Better cookie compatibility

Sanic has added support for [cookie prefixes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#cookie_prefixes), making it seemless and easy to read and write cookies with the values.

While setting the cookie...

```py
response.cookies.add_cookie("foo", "bar", host_prefix=True)
```

This will create the prefixed cookie: `__Host-foo`. However, when accessing the cookie on an incoming request, you can do so without knowing about the existence of the header.

```py
request.cookies.get("foo")
```

It should also be noted, cookies can be accessed as properties just like [headers](#access-any-header-as-a-property).

```python
request.cookies.foo
```

And, cookies are similar to the `request.args` and `request.form` objects in that multiple values can be retrieved using `getlist`.

```py
request.cookies.getlist("foo")
```

Also added is support for creating [partitioned cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#partitioned_cookie).

```py
response.cookies.add_cookie(..., partitioned=True)
```

### ðŸš¨ *BREAKING CHANGE* - More consistent and powerful `SanicException`

Sanic has for a while included the `SanicException` as a base class exception. This could be extended to add `status_code`, etc. [See more details](http://localhost:8080/en/guide/best-practices/exceptions.html).

**NOW**, using all of the various exceptions has become easier. The commonly used exceptions can be imported directly from the root level module.

```python
from sanic import NotFound, Unauthorized, BadRequest, ServerError
```

In addition, all of these arguments are available as keyword arguments on every exception type:

| argument | type | description |
|--|--|--|
| `quiet` | `bool` | Suppress the traceback from the logs |
| `context` | `dict` | Additional information shown in error pages *always* |
| `extra` | `dict` | Additional information shown in error pages in *DEBUG* mode |
| `headers` | `dict` | Additional headers sent in the response |

None of these are themselves new features. However, they are more consistent in how you can use them, thus creating a powerful way to control error responses directly.

```py
raise ServerError(headers={"foo": "bar"})
```

The part of this that is a breaking change is that some formerly positional arguments are now keyword only.

You are encouraged to look at the specific implementations for each error in the [API documents](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sanic/api/exceptions.html#module-sanic.exceptions).

### ðŸš¨ *BREAKING CHANGE* - Refresh `Request.accept` functionality to be more performant and spec-compliant

Parsing od the `Accept` headers into the `Request.accept` accessor has been improved. If you were using this property and relying upon its equality operation, this has changed. You should probably transition to using the `request.accept.match()` method.

### Access any header as a property

To simplify access to headers, you can access a raw (unparsed) version of the header as a property. The name of the header is the name of the property in all lowercase letters, and switching any hyphens (`-`) to underscores (`_`).

For example:

.. column::

    ```
    GET /foo/bar HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost
    User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
    X-Request-ID: 123ABC
    ```

.. column::

    ```py
    request.headers.host
    request.headers.user_agent
    request.headers.x_request_id
    ```

### Consume `DELETE` body by default

By default, the body of a `DELETE` request will now be consumed and read onto the `Request` object. This will make `body` available  like on `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests without any further action.

### Custom `CertLoader` for direct control of creating `SSLContext`

Sometimes you may want to create your own `SSLContext` object. To do this, you can create your own subclass of `CertLoader` that will generate your desired context object.

```python
from sanic.worker.loader import CertLoader

class MyCertLoader(CertLoader):
    def load(self, app: Sanic) -> SSLContext:
        ...

app = Sanic(..., certloader_class=MyCertLoader)
```

### Deprecations and Removals

1. *DEPRECATED* - Dict-style cookie setting
1. *DEPRECATED* - Using existence of JSON data on the request for one factor in using JSON error formatter
1. *REMOVED* -  Remove deprecated `__blueprintname__` property
1. *REMOVED* -  duplicate route names
1. *REMOVED* -  duplicate exception handler definitions
1. *REMOVED* -  inspector CLI with flags
1. *REMOVED* -  legacy server (including `sanic.server.serve_single` and `sanic.server.serve_multiple`)
1. *REMOVED* -  serving directory with bytes string
1. *REMOVED* -  `Request.request_middleware_started`
1. *REMOVED* -  `Websocket.connection`

#### Duplicated route names are no longer allowed

In version 22.9, Sanic announced that v23.3 would deprecate allowing routes to be registered with duplicate names. If you see the following error, it is because of that change:

> sanic.exceptions.ServerError: Duplicate route names detected: SomeApp.some_handler. You should rename one or more of them explicitly by using the `name` param, or changing the implicit name derived from the class and function name. For more details, please see https://sanic.dev/en/guide/release-notes/v23.3.html#duplicated-route-names-are-no-longer-allowed

If you are seeing this, you should opt-in to using explicit names for your routes.

.. column::

    **BAD**
    ```python
    app = Sanic("SomeApp")

    @app.get("/")
    @app.get("/foo")
    async def handler(request: Request):
    ```

.. column::

    **GOOD**
    ```python
    app = Sanic("SomeApp")

    @app.get("/", name="root")
    @app.get("/foo", name="foo")
    async def handler(request: Request):
    ```

#### Response cookies

Response cookies act as a `dict` for compatibility purposes only. In version 24.3, all `dict` methods will be removed and response cookies will be objects only.

Therefore, if you are using this pattern to set cookie properties, you will need to upgrade it before version 24.3.

```python
resp = HTTPResponse()
resp.cookies["foo"] = "bar"
resp.cookies["foo"]["httponly"] = True
```

Instead, you should be using the `add_cookie` method:

```python
resp = HTTPResponse()
resp.add_cookie("foo", "bar", httponly=True)
```

#### Request cookies

Sanic has added support for reading duplicated cookie keys to be more in compliance with RFC specifications. To retain backwards compatibility, accessing a cookie value using `__getitem__` will continue to work to fetch the first value sent. Therefore, in version 23.3 and prior versions this will be `True`.

```python
assert request.cookies["foo"] == "bar"
assert request.cookies.get("foo") == "bar"
```

Version 23.3 added `getlist`

```python
assert request.cookies.getlist("foo") == ["bar"]
```

As stated above, the `get` and `getlist` methods are available similar to how they exist on other request properties (`request.args`, `request.form`, etc). Starting in v24.3, the `__getitem__` method for cookies will work exactly like those properties. This means that `__getitem__` will return a list of values.

Therefore, if you are relying upon this functionality to return only one value, you should upgrade to the following pattern before v24.3.

```python
assert request.cookies["foo"] == ["bar"]
assert request.cookies.get("foo") == "bar"
assert request.cookies.getlist("foo") == ["bar"]
```
