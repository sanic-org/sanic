- [sanic-routing#47](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic-routing/pull/47) Add a new extention parameter type: `<file:ext>`, `<file:ext=jpg>`, `<file:ext=jpg|png|gif|svg>`, `<file=int:ext>`, `<file=int:ext=jpg|png|gif|svg>`, `<file=float:ext=tar.gz>`
    - 👶 *BETA FEATURE*: This feature will not work with `path` type matching, and is being released as a beta feature only.
- [sanic-routing#57](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic-routing/pull/57) Change `register_pattern` to accept a `str` or `Pattern`
- [sanic-routing#58](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic-routing/pull/58) Default matching on non-empty strings only, and new `strorempty` pattern type
    - 🚨 *BREAKING CHANGE*: Previously a route with a dynamic string parameter (`/<foo>` or `/<foo:str>`) would match on any string, including empty strings. It will now **only** match a non-empty string. To retain the old behavior, you should use the new parameter type: `/<foo:strorempty>`.

## Version 19.12.0

**Bugfixes**

-   Fix blueprint middleware application

    Currently, any blueprint middleware registered, irrespective of
    which blueprint was used to do so, was being applied to all of the
    routes created by the `@app` and `@blueprint` alike.

    As part of this change, the blueprint based middleware application
    is enforced based on where they are registered.

    -   If you register a middleware via `@blueprint.middleware` then it
        will apply only to the routes defined by the blueprint.
    -   If you register a middleware via `@blueprint_group.middleware`
        then it will apply to all blueprint based routes that are part
        of the group.
    -   If you define a middleware via `@app.middleware` then it will be
        applied on all available routes
        ([#37](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/37))

-   Fix [url_for]{.title-ref} behavior with missing SERVER_NAME

    If the [SERVER_NAME]{.title-ref} was missing in the
    [app.config]{.title-ref} entity, the [url_for]{.title-ref} on the
    [request]{.title-ref} and [app]{.title-ref} were failing due to an
    [AttributeError]{.title-ref}. This fix makes the availability of
    [SERVER_NAME]{.title-ref} on our [app.config]{.title-ref} an
    optional behavior.
    ([#1707](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/1707))

**Improved Documentation**

-   Move docs from MD to RST

    Moved all docs from markdown to restructured text like the rest of
    the docs to unify the scheme and make it easier in the future to
    update documentation.
    ([#1691](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/1691))

-   Fix documentation for [get]{.title-ref} and [getlist]{.title-ref} of
    the [request.args]{.title-ref}

    Add additional example for showing the usage of
    [getlist]{.title-ref} and fix the documentation string for
    [request.args]{.title-ref} behavior
    ([#1704](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/1704))

## Version 19.6.3

**Features**

-   Enable Towncrier Support

    As part of this feature, [towncrier]{.title-ref} is being introduced
    as a mechanism to partially automate the process of generating and
    managing change logs as part of each of pull requests.
    ([#1631](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/1631))

**Improved Documentation**

-   Documentation infrastructure changes
    -   Enable having a single common [CHANGELOG]{.title-ref} file for
        both GitHub page and documentation
    -   Fix Sphinix deprecation warnings
    -   Fix documentation warnings due to invalid [rst]{.title-ref}
        indentation
    -   Enable common contribution guidelines file across GitHub and
        documentation via [CONTRIBUTING.rst]{.title-ref}
        ([#1631](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/1631))

-   [#1568](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1568) Deprecate
    route removal.

.. warning:: Warning

    Sanic will not support Python 3.5 from version 19.6 and forward. 
    However, version 18.12LTS will have its support period extended thru
    December 2020, and therefore passing Python\'s official support version
    3.5, which is set to expire in September 2020.

## Version 19.3

**Features**

-   [#1497](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1497) Add support
    for zero-length and RFC 5987 encoded filename for
    multipart/form-data requests.

-   [#1484](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1484) The type of
    `expires` attribute of `sanic.cookies.Cookie` is now enforced to
    be of type `datetime`.

-   [#1482](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1482) Add support
    for the `stream` parameter of `sanic.Sanic.add_route()` available
    to `sanic.Blueprint.add_route()`.

-   [#1481](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1481) Accept
    negative values for route parameters with type `int` or `number`.

-   [#1476](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1476) Deprecated
    the use of `sanic.request.Request.raw_args` - it has a fundamental
    flaw in which is drops repeated query string parameters. Added
    `sanic.request.Request.query_args` as a replacement for the
    original use-case.

-   [#1472](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1472) Remove an
    unwanted `None` check in Request class `repr` implementation. This
    changes the default `repr` of a Request from `<Request>` to
    `<Request: None />`

-   [#1470](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1470) Added 2 new
    parameters to `sanic.app.Sanic.create_server`:

    -   `return_asyncio_server` - whether to return an
        asyncio.Server.
    -   `asyncio_server_kwargs` - kwargs to pass to
        `loop.create_server` for the event loop that sanic is using.
    >
    This is a breaking change.

-   [#1499](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1499) Added a set
    of test cases that test and benchmark route resolution.

-   [#1457](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1457) The type of
    the `"max-age"` value in a `sanic.cookies.Cookie` is now enforced
    to be an integer. Non-integer values are replaced with `0`.

-   [#1445](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1445) Added the
    `endpoint` attribute to an incoming `request`, containing the name
    of the handler function.

-   [#1423](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1423) Improved
    request streaming. `request.stream` is now a bounded-size buffer
    instead of an unbounded queue. Callers must now call
    `await request.stream.read()` instead of
    `await request.stream.get()` to read each portion of the body.

    This is a breaking change.

**Bugfixes**

-   [#1502](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1502) Sanic was
    prefetching `time.time()` and updating it once per second to avoid
    excessive `time.time()` calls. The implementation was observed to
    cause memory leaks in some cases. The benefit of the prefetch
    appeared to negligible, so this has been removed. Fixes
    [#1500](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1500)
-   [#1501](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1501) Fix a bug in
    the auto-reloader when the process was launched as a module i.e.
    `python -m init0.mod1` where the sanic server is started in
    `init0/mod1.py` with `debug` enabled and imports another module in
    `init0`.
-   [#1376](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1376) Allow sanic
    test client to bind to a random port by specifying `port=None`
    when constructing a `SanicTestClient`
-   [#1399](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1399) Added the
    ability to specify middleware on a blueprint group, so that all
    routes produced from the blueprints in the group have the
    middleware applied.
-   [#1442](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/pull/1442) Allow the
    the use the `SANIC_ACCESS_LOG` environment variable to
    enable/disable the access log when not explicitly passed to
    `app.run()`. This allows the access log to be disabled for example
    when running via gunicorn.

    -   Added stream_large_files and host examples in static_file
        document
    -   Added methods to append and finish body content on Request
        (#1379)
    -   Integrated with .appveyor.yml for windows ci support
    -   Added documentation for AF_INET6 and AF_UNIX socket usage
    -   Adopt black/isort for codestyle

    -   Pinned httptools requirement to version 0.0.10+

-   Fixes:

    -   Fix `remove_entity_headers` helper function (#1415)
    -   Fix TypeError when use Blueprint.group() to group blueprint
        with default url_prefix, Use os.path.normpath to avoid invalid
        url_prefix like api//v1 f8a6af1 Rename the `http` module to
        `helpers` to prevent conflicts with the built-in Python http
        library (fixes #1323)
    -   Fix unittests on windows
    -   Fix Namespacing of sanic logger
    -   Fix missing quotes in decorator example

    -   Fix pickling blueprints Change the string passed in the
        \"name\" section of the namedtuples in Blueprint to match the
        name of the Blueprint module attribute name. This allows
        blueprints to be pickled and unpickled, without errors, which
        is a requirement of running Sanic in multiprocessing mode in
        Windows. Added a test for pickling and unpickling blueprints
        Added a test for pickling and unpickling sanic itself Added a
        test for enabling multiprocessing on an app with a blueprint
        (only useful to catch this bug if the tests are run on
        Windows).
