# Version 25.12 (LTS)

.. toc::

## Introduction

Version 25.12 is the **Long Term Support (LTS)** release for the version 25 [release cycle](../../organization/policies.md#release-schedule). As an LTS release, it will receive security updates and critical bug fixes for an extended period. If you run into any issues, please raise a concern on [GitHub](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/new/choose).

## What to know

More details in the [Changelog](../changelog.html). Notable new or breaking features, and what to upgrade:

### Python 3.9 removed, Python 3.14 added

Sanic now requires **Python 3.10 or newer**. Python 3.9 has been dropped, and Python 3.14 support has been added.

### Daemon mode

You can now run Sanic as a background daemon process directly from the CLI.

```sh
sanic path.to.app -D
sanic path.to.app --daemon
```

This also introduces convenience commands for managing daemon processes:

```sh
sanic path.to.app status    # Check if running
sanic path.to.app stop      # Stop the daemon
```

Additional options are available:

```sh
--pidfile PATH    # Custom PID file location
--logfile PATH    # Log output to file
--user USER       # Run as specified user
--group GROUP     # Run as specified group
```

Lower-level commands are also available:

```sh
sanic kill --pid=<PID>
sanic kill --pidfile=<PATH>
sanic status --pid=<PID>
sanic status --pidfile=<PATH>
```

### Symlink control for static files

Sanic now provides granular control over symlinks in static file serving with two new parameters:

| Parameter                       | Default | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `follow_external_symlink_files` | `False` | Allow serving file symlinks that point outside the static root                 |
| `follow_external_symlink_dirs`  | `False` | Allow serving files from directory symlinks that point outside the static root |

**Examples**

Secure defaults (block external symlinks):

```python
# Symlinks pointing outside /var/www/static will return 404
app.static("/static", "/var/www/static")
```

Allow file symlinks only:

```python
# Serves /var/www/static/config.json -> /etc/app/config.json
app.static("/static", "/var/www/static", follow_external_symlink_files=True)
```

Allow directory symlinks only:

```python
# Serves files from /var/www/static/images/ -> /shared/images/
app.static("/static", "/var/www/static", follow_external_symlink_dirs=True)
```

### Custom configuration converters

You can now extend how Sanic parses environment variables into configuration values. By default, Sanic converts environment variables using `str`, `str_to_bool`, `float`, and `int` converters (tried in reverse order). You can add your own converters to handle custom types.

**Simple converter** - a callable that takes a string and returns a converted value:

```python
class UltimateAnswer:
    def __init__(self, answer):
        self.answer = int(answer)

config = Config(converters=[UltimateAnswer])
app = Sanic("MyApp", config=config)

# Or register after creation
app.config.register_type(UltimateAnswer)
```

**DetailedConverter** - for converters that need more context (full key name, config key, value, and defaults):

```python
from sanic.config import Config, DetailedConverter

class TypeAwareConverter(DetailedConverter):
    def __call__(self, full_key: str, config_key: str, value: str, defaults: dict):
        if config_key in defaults:
            # Cast to the same type as the default value
            return type(defaults[config_key])(value)
        raise ValueError  # Fall through to next converter

config = Config(
    defaults={"PORT": 8000, "DEBUG": False},
    converters=[TypeAwareConverter()]
)
```

### Automatic charset for text content types

Text content types (`text/*`) now automatically include `charset=UTF-8` when serving static files and file responses.

### Task creation returns the task

When creating a task via `app.add_task()`, the asyncio `Task` object is now returned, allowing you to await or check its result later.

```python
task = app.add_task(some_coroutine())
# Later...
result = await task
```

### Improved CLI error messages

Tracerite has been upgraded to v2.2.0, providing better formatted exception tracebacks in the CLI with improved chained exception display.
