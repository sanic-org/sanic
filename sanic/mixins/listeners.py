            Overloaded signatures allow for different ways of calling this method, depending on the types of the arguments.

            Usually, it is prederred to use one of the convenience methods such as `before_server_start` or `after_server_stop` instead of calling this method directly.

            ```python
            @app.before_server_start
            async def prefered_method(_):
                ...

            @app.listener("before_server_start")
            async def not_prefered_method(_):
                ...

        Args:
            listener_or_event (Union[ListenerType[Sanic], str]): A listener function or an event name.
            event_or_none (Optional[str]): The event name to listen for if `listener_or_event` is a function. Defaults to `None`.
            apply (bool): Whether to apply the listener immediately. Defaults to `True`.
            priority (int): The priority of the listener. Defaults to `0`.

        Returns:
            Union[ListenerType[Sanic], Callable[[ListenerType[Sanic]], ListenerType[Sanic]]]: The listener or a callable that takes a listener.

        Example:
            The following code snippet shows how you can use this method as a decorator:
