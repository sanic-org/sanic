        Decorate and register middleware to be called before a request is
        handled or after a response is created. Can either be called as
        *@app.middleware* or *@app.middleware('request')*. Although, it is
        recommended to use *@app.on_request* or *@app.on_response* instead
        for clarity and convenience.

        See [Middleware](/guide/basics/middleware) for more information.

        Finalization consists of identifying defined routes and optimizing
        Sanic's performance to meet the application's specific needs. If

            process and does not typically need to be invoked manually.
